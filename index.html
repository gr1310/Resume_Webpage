                <h4>Predicting House Prices: Machine Learning for Real Estate Analysis</h4>
                <p>Course project</p>
                <p>I worked on this task of creating a house price prediction model using Random Forest Algorithm. The project
                    was centered on the basics of Machine Learning and utilized a dataset from Kaggle containing information
                    about houses in Delhi. The aim was to develop a model capable of accurate predictions. </p>

                <h4>Software Stack for IoT devices</h4>
                <p>OELP</p>
                <p>In collaboration with a partner, I engaged in a group project based on safe communication between IoT devices
                    and Cloud. Our objective was to look for most effective light weigh crptographic algorithms to ensure and
                    enhance security and privacy aspects of IoT devices</p>

                <h4>Raspberry Pi 3 GUI for Connecting to Nearby Bluetooth Devices</h4>
                <p>Self done project</p>
                <p>Continuing from the OELP project, I took the initiative to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using
                    the Python tkinter library. This GUI was specifically designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 3, and it facilitated
                    the connection to nearby Bluetooth devices by utilizing the Bluetooth capabilities of the Pi through Python
                    programming.</p>
